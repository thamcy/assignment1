		Walk a little further and you will see the distinctive wave-like structure of the 274m-long pedestrian bridge that matches it's name perfectly.
		<br>
		This charming, wood-panelled bridge was built to improve connectivity between nature areas.
		A series of seven undulating "ribs" double up as alcoves and provide shelter. 
		Between 7pm to 7am, the bridge takes on a different look, with the wave-form lit up by attractive LED lights.
		<br>
		Birdwatchers visiting between September and April get to spot various birds, such as the Brahminy Kite (<i>Haliastur indus</i>), 
		raptors and other winter visitors, from atop the bridge.
		Take a quick breather at the old guard house and hydrate yourself before carrying on with the journey.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong> Note: </strong> The Henderson Waves is a popular spot for couples, wedding photos, instagrammers and many more.
			It might be very crowded when you go so be prepared!
